# Homify
A mobile application that allows real estate companies to remotely unlock homes for potential buyers to view.

## Setup
# Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

Node.js: Install Node.js (v14 or later). 
npm or Yarn: Package manager (npm comes bundled with Node.js).
Expo CLI

```
npm install -g expo-cli

git clone 'repository-url'

npm install
```


Run the project using expo start or npm start

Login into the application using any credentials, as I have not configured any particular test credentials. I have used dummy images and dummy api data for the home listing, used a library for the calculation of the 30m range and show the unlock button accordingly.
